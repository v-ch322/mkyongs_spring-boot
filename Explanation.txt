The initial data data were taken from:
https://github.com/mkyong/docker-java/docker-spring-boot
The sample was prepared by Yong Mook Kim.
These data seem interesting for the some modification since the operation sequence
***
$ git clone https://github.com/mkyong/docker-java
$ cd docker-spring-boot
$ mvn clean package
$ java -jar target/spring-boot-web.jar

docker build -t spring-boot:1.0 .
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -t spring-boot:1.0
***
where one should have installed openjdk (maven) for preparation of initial file in its own PC
could be simplified using typical for java docker multistage build.

The data of mkyong were unchanged, I changed only Dockerfile and added the simplest docker-compose.yml.
After the cloning the repo container can be obtained by:
cd mkyongs_spring-boot
docker-compose up -d

The result will be seen in your browser : http://127.0.0.1:8000.
